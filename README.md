# generation_z_hackathon_winner

We as a team was competing in the first hackathon held by Socar and 4SIM in the campus 
of BHOS.
We were competing in the name under "Generation Z". And we have got the 3rd place.
Our startup idea was to create a automating platform for agriculture businesses.
As a prototype we have created the two internet connected robots based on esp32 and a  website to 
easily interconnect them and get the data from them.
